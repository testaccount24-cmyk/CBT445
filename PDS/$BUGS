       The following bugs and limitations need fixing.

DISAS does not always generate USING statements in the right place.

The tables to hold sections, entry points and externs are fixed size. If they
fill up the dissassembly fails. They should be dynamically sized.

Immediate and relative instructions are not supported.

Registers should be equated to R0, R1, etc instead of appearing as numbers.

Extended Mnemonics should be generated for conditional branch instructions

Vector instructions are not supported.

Information from SYM cards is not fully exploited. SYM data should be used to
tell what is instructions and what is data. And used to format the data area.

The data area should be better formatted. Fields should be the length
they are referenced as.

It should be possible to enter parameters to say what parts are instructions
and how to format data. And where USINGs and DROPs are.

Instructions for IEEE format floating point instructions and additional floating
point registers are not supported.

Z/Series instructions are not supported.

DISYM produces duplicate DSECTs if more than one module in a LMOD
invokes a given DSECT.
