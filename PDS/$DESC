  This is a rewrite of the dissassembler package on files U08010,
U08013 and U08014 of the UK Guide tape (CBT overflow tape file 12).  It
reads an object deck as input. Drivers to delink load modules and
disassemble them are also provided.

  You need either DELINK0, which is provided in this file, or DELINKI
off CBT file 90 to delink load modules. See CBT file 316 for a
dissassembly of DELINK0 with full instructions.  You can get an
executable version of DELINKI on CBT file 135 if you don't have a PL/I
compiler.

  The test job needs COMPARE  off CBT file 149 to compare LMODS or an
equivalent product.


Unfortunately my company is downsizing, so from the end of June 2004 I
will not have access to a mainframe. So if anyone wants to enhance this
they are welcome, I will not be able to.
